# PracticeSite1
A site practicing what I have learned so far and I will also add some things I learn on my own
## To Do List 1.0
- [ ] Create the basic files and folders for the site   
- [ ] Choose the colors and font for the site  
- [ ] Make the XD files for the site and work out the layout for the pages. Make corrections if needed.  
- [ ] Code the index.html file with the decided elements. 
## What will be on this site
This site will be a online fitness app in which you will be able to plan out your exercise over the certain amount of time.  
I have yet to decide if I want to make it so that it were the app is only 2 and 8 week meso cycles or if the user  
is the one that decided the length.
