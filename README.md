# PracticeSite1
A site practicing what I have learned so far and I will also add some things I learn on my own
## To Do List 1.0
- [x] Create the basic files and folders for the site   
- [x] Choose the colors and font for the site  
- [x] Make the XD files for the site and work out the layout for the pages. Make corrections if needed.  
- [x] Code the index.html file with the decided elements. 
1.0 Update- This update will have the above all completed. The basic outline of the pages for the site 
is done and the colors have been commented on the css page. The xd file was uploaded in the OtherContent  
file
## What will be on this site
This site will be a online fitness app in which you will be able to plan out your exercise over the certain amount of time.  
I have yet to decide if I want to make it so that it were the app is only 2 and 8 week meso cycles or if the user  
is the one that decided the length.
